"""R3 server-side swarm orchestrator — run a CLI swarm member end-to-end.

This is the glue tying together the already-built Wave 1/2 pieces (see
`SWARM-RECONCILIATION.md`, "R3 Concrete Plan"): the SwarmStore (state), the agent
argv resolver, the git-worktree-per-member lifecycle, the file-bus, and the
ownership detect/revert plane. It is the **headless execution backend** of R3's
two-backend split — the server spawns each CLI as a plain subprocess in its own
worktree; the GUI/Tauri PTY backend is the other (out of scope here).

The design centers on two things the tests pin down:

1. **An injectable spawn seam.** No real `claude`/`codex` binary exists in CI, so
   spawning is a `SpawnFn` the caller supplies. The default `subprocess_spawn`
   wraps `subprocess.Popen` (no shell) for production; tests pass a fake.

2. **Deterministic post-exit ownership reconciliation.** R3's ownership guarantee
   for black-box CLIs is post-hoc (the watcher can't gate a write before it
   lands). So *after* the member process exits we do the authoritative check —
   `changed_files` → `detect_violations` → revert + escalate — rather than racing
   live fs events. A live `OwnershipWatcher` may run alongside as
   belt-and-suspenders, but correctness never depends on it firing.

This module is the "control + enforcement plane" half: it owns the worktree
lifecycle and ownership reconciliation. It is intentionally free of any FastAPI /
SSE import — the caller (the swarm route) passes an `on_event` callback that
forwards the plain event dicts to the SSE emitter.

    Steps (see SWARM-RECONCILIATION "R3 Concrete Plan"):

      2. Write the file-bus task (+ shared context) into the MAIN repo's
         `.voss/swarm/<id>/` — NOT the worktree. The member is hermetic in its
         worktree and gets its task inline via the resolved argv's trailing
         task_text; the file-bus is the shared host-side record.
      3. Mark the task assigned, resolve argv, spawn into the worktree, wait.
      4. **Deterministic** ownership reconciliation post-exit: diff the worktree,
         detect out-of-`owned_files` writes, revert them, and emit a
         `swarm.needs_operator` event. (A live OwnershipWatcher runs alongside as
         belt-and-suspenders, but the verdict here is the authority.)
      5. Merge the (now in-scope) worktree, read the member's result summary, mark
         the task done, and tear the worktree down.

    The member's result file is written into the MAIN repo's shared file-bus
    (`.voss/swarm/<id>/results/<role>.result.md`) — the host hands the CLI that
    absolute path so the worktree stays hermetic — so it is read from `repo_root`.
