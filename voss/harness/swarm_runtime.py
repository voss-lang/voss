    Steps (see SWARM-RECONCILIATION "R3 Concrete Plan"):
      1. `git worktree add` an isolated checkout for the role.
      2. Write the file-bus task (+ shared context) into the MAIN repo's
         `.voss/swarm/<id>/` — NOT the worktree. The member is hermetic in its
         worktree and gets its task inline via the resolved argv's trailing
         task_text; the file-bus is the shared host-side record.
      3. Mark the task assigned, resolve argv, spawn into the worktree, wait.
      4. **Deterministic** ownership reconciliation post-exit: diff the worktree,
         detect out-of-`owned_files` writes, revert them, and emit a
         `swarm.needs_operator` event. (A live OwnershipWatcher runs alongside as
         belt-and-suspenders, but the verdict here is the authority.)
      5. Commit the (now in-scope) worktree as an immutable candidate. Preserve
         its branch/worktree for explicit review and integration. A clean no-change
         run has no candidate and may be marked done + cleaned up immediately.

    The member's result file is written into the MAIN repo's shared file-bus
    (`.voss/swarm/<id>/results/<role>.result.md`) — the host hands the CLI that
    absolute path so the worktree stays hermetic — so it is read from `repo_root`.
