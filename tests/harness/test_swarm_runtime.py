"""R3 swarm runtime orchestrator tests (SWARM-RECONCILIATION, Wave 3).

Drives `run_cli_member` / `run_cli_swarm` end-to-end against a REAL temp git repo
(mirrors tests/harness/test_layout.py + test_swarm_worktree.py `_git` style) with
a FAKE spawn_fn — no real `claude`/`codex` is ever launched, and nothing uses
`time.sleep` for synchronization.

Each fake spawn writes inside the worktree cwd it is handed (simulating the CLI
doing its work in its own checkout), then returns a handle whose `wait()` returns
an exit code. Correctness of the ownership reconciliation is asserted on the MAIN
branch state AFTER the run, which is what the deterministic post-exit check (not a
racing watcher) guarantees.
